# Project Roadmap

## High-Level Goals
- Port web application to mobile with exact feature parity
- Maintain identical calculation accuracy between platforms
- Match web UI/UX precisely using native components
- Focus on core features: wind calculator, shot calculator, weather display, and settings

## Key Features

### Future Considerations
- Dashboard implementation (deferred)
- Additional features after core parity achieved
- Performance optimizations maintaining accuracy

## Completion Criteria
1. Mobile screens exactly match web counterparts
2. Calculations produce identical results
3. UI/UX matches web version precisely
4. All features have perfect parity
5. Comprehensive testing verifies equality

## Progress Tracking

### Completed
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Access to web calculation models
- [x] Basic UI component framework
- [x] Core navigation structure

### In Progress
- [ ] Wind calculator exact match
- [ ] Shot calculator perfect parity
- [ ] Weather display identical implementation
- [ ] Settings screen precise copy

### Upcoming
- [ ] Calculation accuracy verification
- [ ] UI/UX parity testing
- [ ] Cross-device validation
- [ ] Performance optimization within parity constraints

## Future Scalability
1. Maintain perfect parity with web updates
2. Ensure calculation models stay synchronized
3. Keep UI/UX in exact alignment
4. Preserve feature equality across platforms

## Reference Implementation
- Web version (`app/` directory) is source of truth
- No modifications to web version allowed
- Mobile must adapt to match web exactly
- All features must maintain perfect parity
