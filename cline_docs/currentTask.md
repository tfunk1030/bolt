# Current Task: Mobile Core Screens Implementation

## Current Objectives
- Implementing core mobile screens to exactly match existing web version:
  1. Wind Calculator (match web implementation in `app/wind-calc/`)
  2. Shot Calculator (match web implementation in `app/shot-calculator/`)
  3. Weather Display (match web weather display)
  4. Settings (match web settings interface)

## Context
- Web version is complete and serves as the reference implementation
- Mobile version must maintain perfect parity with web version
- All calculations must match web version's accuracy
- UI must mirror web version's layout and functionality

## Next Steps
1. Audit web version implementations for each core screen
2. Port exact calculation models from web to mobile
3. Implement identical UI layouts with React Native components
4. Verify calculation accuracy matches web version
5. Test on both iOS and Android simulators

## Technical Notes
- Using react-native-safe-area-context@4.7.4 for mobile safe area handling
- Reusing exact calculation logic from web version
- UI components must provide identical functionality to web
- No modifications to web version allowed - it's the reference implementation

## Important Considerations
- Web version is the source of truth - no deviations allowed
- Mobile version must maintain exact calculation accuracy
- UI/UX must match web version while using native components
- All features must have perfect parity between platforms
- Dashboard implementation deferred to future builds

## Progress
- [x] Basic navigation setup
- [x] Core UI components
- [x] Access to web version calculation engines
- [ ] Complete wind calculator screen (match web version)
- [ ] Complete shot calculator screen (match web version)
- [ ] Complete weather display screen (match web version)
- [ ] Complete settings screen (match web version)
- [ ] Cross-device testing

## Implementation Notes
1. Wind Calculator Screen
   - Port exact calculations from web version
   - Match web UI layout precisely
   - Ensure identical accuracy in results

2. Shot Calculator Screen
   - Use identical club selection logic
   - Match web trajectory calculations exactly
   - Replicate web UI with native components

3. Weather Display Screen
   - Use same weather data processing
   - Match web display format
   - Maintain calculation accuracy

4. Settings Screen
   - Mirror web settings options exactly
   - Maintain identical functionality
   - Match web UI layout
