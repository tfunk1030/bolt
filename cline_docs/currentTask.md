# Current Task: Mobile Core Screens Implementation

## Current Objectives
- Implementing core mobile screens to exactly match existing web version:
  1. Wind Calculator (match web implementation in `app/wind-calc/`)
     - [x] Type system implementation
     - [x] Wind direction compass component
     - [ ] Complete screen implementation
  2. Shot Calculator (match web implementation in `app/shot-calculator/`)
  3. Weather Display (match web weather display)
  4. Settings (match web settings interface)

## Context
- Web version is complete and serves as the reference implementation
- Mobile version must maintain perfect parity with web version
- All calculations must match web version's accuracy
- UI must mirror web version's layout and functionality
- Type safety is now enforced through custom type definitions

## Next Steps
1. Complete wind calculator screen implementation
   - [ ] Integrate wind direction compass component
   - [ ] Add remaining UI elements
   - [ ] Implement calculation logic
   - [ ] Test against web version
2. Port exact calculation models from web to mobile
3. Implement identical UI layouts with React Native components
4. Verify calculation accuracy matches web version
5. Test on both iOS and Android simulators

## Technical Notes
- Using react-native-safe-area-context@4.7.4 for mobile safe area handling
- React Native Skia for advanced graphics and visualizations
- React Native Gesture Handler for touch interactions
- Custom type definitions ensure implementation accuracy
- Reusing exact calculation logic from web version
- UI components must provide identical functionality to web
- No modifications to web version allowed - it's the reference implementation

## Important Considerations
- Web version is the source of truth - no deviations allowed
- Mobile version must maintain exact calculation accuracy
- UI/UX must match web version while using native components
- All features must have perfect parity between platforms
- Type safety must be maintained across all components
- Dashboard implementation deferred to future builds

## Progress
- [x] Basic navigation setup
- [x] Core UI components
- [x] Access to web version calculation engines
- [x] Type system implementation
- [x] Wind direction compass component
- [ ] Complete wind calculator screen (match web version)
- [ ] Complete shot calculator screen (match web version)
- [ ] Complete weather display screen (match web version)
- [ ] Complete settings screen (match web version)
- [ ] Cross-device testing
